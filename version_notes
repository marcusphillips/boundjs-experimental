1.3.1
---
- deprecated react.nodes hash, react.scopes hash, and react.name(object, nameKey) - nodes and scope objects are not centrally stored anymore, and global the scope feature isnt supported fully enough yet to leave in
- (internal) directives are refered to by persistent keys, not thier index in the string
- (internal) js.* iterators now pass the item as the first argument to the callback block
- (internal) js.* iterators now run in the context of the input collection, unless you pass a context argument in after the block.
- (internal) js.* iterators can accept strings and arrays to be transformed into a block
- (internal) anchors now stored on node proxies, rather than in central hash
- (internal) annotating objects via bound.prototype closure scope, rather than with string serializations
- (internal) using a Resolution class to handle .lookup() operation

1.3
---
- react automatically integrates with jQuery if it is available in the global scope
- 'anchor' is no longer a valid option to react.update()
- .update() now takes only one input, a DOM node or jQuery object with one element. It does not accept options or scope objects
  - you can no longer update against a scope without anchoring to it
- lookup failures for within directive turns off render and display of that node
- anchored nodes...
  - don't inherit parent's scope chain
  - aren't visited in updates to parent nodes
- react.anchor() always incurs an update
- new jQuery helper, .update(), which updates the target node
- fromDirective no longer a valid input to react.update()
- (internal) command functions now receive pre-resolved inputs
- (internal) allows for custom name resultion through use of .resolve_*() functions on command object

1.2.5
---
- no interface changes
- full use of prototypes and pseudoclassical patterns (to take advantage of the browser optimizations fo them)

1.2.4
---
- no interface changes
- moving toward usage of protoypal patterns internally

1.2.3
---
- no interface changes

1.2.2
---
- results container no longer used for iteration directives. results are now stored as siblings of the template node

1.2.1
---
- new directive 'debug' halts at a debugger breakpoint as soon as the directive gets followed
- new directive 'debugIf' halts only when first argument is truthy
- new directive 'log' outputs information about its arguments

- react.integrate.jQuery() no longer adds an update() methoed. it instead provides .anchor(), which operates the same but always anchors in the process
  - also adds a .items() helper to jqeury objects that returns all the elements generated during iteration.
  -  and .item(index) provides a single item from the generated nodes
- react.helpers(object) adds .set(), .del(), .changed(), .anchor() to the object

1.2
---
- new directive 'log' outputs information about the current rendering context and any inputs
- lookups in scope chain fail only when property is not in the object at all, rather than when it is present but set to undefined
- allows for progressive rendering
  - dot access into undefined and null properties resolves to undefined, rather than erroring
  - the scope extension directives 'within', 'withinItem', and 'anchored' do not error when scope is undefined
  - withinItem passes if the top scope is not an array-like object

1.1.3
- any node substituted by a 'contain' directive does not inherit the containing scope chain, and is not recursed onto for an update operation

1.1.2 - cleanup and bug fixes
---
- Bugfix: In ie, react was iterating into loop templates. expando data properties were being copied, but now using jquery's .data() function
- Bugfix: In ie, react would error on trying to work with the object returned from querySelectorAll()
- Large under-the-hood revision to structure and readability
